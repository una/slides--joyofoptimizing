            - Before I start, I want to stress that image optimization is a team problem
            - and this is because performance is your user experience
            - it may be the most important thing about your application that differentiates it from competition
            - So it doesn't matter if you're a designer or a developer or a PM, you're a *teammate*, and this is a *team* problem
            - the point is that we can't do this
            - just throw it over the fence to another team, we need to take responsibility for image performance on every level

            - PNG is an example of lossless compression, it doesn't lose quality.
            - PNG uses delta compression
            - difference of one pixel to another (bc most images have large areas of similar color)
            - chooses the pixel closest in value (hoping to be 0) which decreases overall file size
            - jpg also looks at difference of one pixel to another and discards the excess (it rounds where it can)

            - jpg is really smart, it goes through a several-step process for compression
            - first it breaks up RGB into black and white (Y), red chroma (red-green), and blue chroma channels (blue-yellow)
            - goes through DCT to create 64 coefficients within this 8 pixel grid
            - then, goes through quantization -- which is based on a lookup-table corresponsing to image quality that you set when saving the jpg
            - convert to a new, compressed value, it's where the most visual information is lost
            - The upper left corner is the DC coefficient, which is just the unweighted average, and the others are called the AC coefficients, which really represent the difference in color detail
            - Runs through another algorithm to find averages and recompile color information and resaves the image
            - saves space on the server
            - lossy isn't a bad thing

          - and people are continuing to iterate on JPEG because its so widely used
          - Google *just* released Guetzli, a new open source algorithm last month

            - one on the right is guetzli compression, center is normal png compression
            - you can see very small differences in color, but its hard to see
            - Guetzli uses an AI-based compression metric
            - that incorporates the concept of cells in the retina to make decisions in quantization
            - the quantization table changes per image with Guetzli, it's not an absolute set of values like it normally is
            - tradeoff: images take longer to compress and results are unreliable
            - especially true on smaller images (works best as larger sizes)

            - there was an article that came out yesterday from Eric Portis at Cloudinary that looked more closely into this
            - he compared a few examples, and saw that Guetzli saved images a bit more sharply than auto compression, which he compared it to
            - q_auto is "automatic quality" within Cloudinary

  - we're going to take a slight aside (but its not really an aside) to talk about blend modes
  - blend modes are really exciting and more people should know about how powerful they are
  - To me, they can really bring more color, uniformity, and art to the web -- something Jenn was also talking about in her talk
  - so lets do a brief primer on them

            - Some even called them "unusable"
            - And one woman I talked to, Leigh Pieterson said this quote:
            - "If it doesn't work offline, it won't catch on"
